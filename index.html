                <h1>A personal favorite</h1>
                <h6>A policeman was interrogating 3 guys who were training to become detectives. To test their skills in recognizing a suspect, he shows the first guys a picture for 5 seconds and then hides it. "This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?"<span class="badge badge-secondary">Stolen from r/jokes</span></h6>
                <p>
                The first guy answers, "That's easy, we'll catch him fast because he only has one eye!"</p>
                <p>
                The policeman says, "Well...uh...that's because the picture I showed is his side profile."</p>
                <p>
                Slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashes the picture for 5 seconds at the second guy and asks him, "This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?"</p>
                <p>
                The second guy smiles, flips his hair and says, "Ha! He'd be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!"</p>
                <p>
                The policeman angrily responds, "What's the matter with you two?!!? Of course only one eye and one ear are showing because it's a picture of his side profile! Is that the best answer you can come up with?"</p>
                <p>
                Extremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to the third guy and in a very testy voice asks, "This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?</p>
                <p>
                He quickly adds, "Think hard before giving me a stupid answer."
                </p>
                <p>
                The third guy looks at the picture intently for a moment and says, "The suspect wears contact lenses."
                </p>
                <p>
                The policeman is surprised and speechless because he really doesn't know himself if the suspect wears contacts or not.
                </p>
                <p>
                "Well, that's an interesting answer. Wait here for a few minutes while I check his file and I'll get back to you on that."
                </p>
                <p>
                He leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the suspect's file on his computer and comes back with a beaming smile on his face.
                </p>
                <p>
                "Wow! I can't believe it. It's TRUE! The suspect does, in fact, wear contact lenses. Good work! How were you able to make such an astute observation?"
                </p>
                <p>
                "That's easy..." the third guy replied. "He can't wear regular glasses because he only has one eye and one ear."</p>
