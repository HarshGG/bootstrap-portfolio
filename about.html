                        It is a fact that in this contemporary world we live in, constant progress can be observed everywhere. But, with the convenience of new innovations comes not only new problems, but also new goals to be achieved. Despite the extent to which technology has advanced, it can always be better. Well renowned entrepreneur and innovator, Bill Gates, had once stated, “The computer was born to solve problems that did not exist before”: thus highlighting that the art of computer science aids mankind overcome current obstacles, enabling one to further innovate and invent. This power of computer science is the main factor that persuaded me into opting it as my major, and my career in the near future. Born and raised in the dawn of the twenty-first century, I have first-hand witnessed technology evolve from stodgy, slow, and impractical computers to sleek, swift, and pragmatic devices. Even more impressive is the fact that even if it may seem further advance is not possible, computer science proves that assumption wrong by its ability to improve upon everything constantly. Thus, I have observed a sign that as time progresses, the need for knowledgeable people in the field of computers increases: indicating to me that this field is ever-expanding and I’ll have various opportunities to learn and contribute to society. By opting Computer Science to be my major, I am giving myself access to countless opportunities supervised by experienced individuals in college, which will thus aid me expand my knowledge and experience in this field. This will not only make me eligible to sharpen my intellect in computer science, but also help me meet new people who are as interested in such innovation as I am: ensuring I will forever be expanding my abilities. Moreover, I will, after completing a major in computer science, be able to gain opportunities in my professional life and innovate to benefit and contribute to the society I live in. Hence, observing all the benefits of this field, in addition to my ages old admiration for it, I decided it would be smart of me to major in it and integrate it into my daily life.
